Remark:

Run Kernel2016.m, which will run both MF2016K_main.m and MF2016KPureSSystem_main.m that will generate combined figure from the experimental data and from the three different models.

Running MF2016K_main.m or MF2016KPureSSystem_main individually will only plot the simulated data from the respective model.
